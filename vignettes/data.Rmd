Scraping large datasets from the NCAA stats pages can take a long time. So I have already scraped all of the data from 2020-2024 and stored it here. This currently includes team and player season data, team and player match data, and match play-by-play data for women's and men's Division 1, 2, and 3 volleyball from 2020-2024. 

Each sport (`wvb` = women's, `mvb` = men's), data level (`teamseason` = team season, `playerseason` = player season, `teammatch` = team match, `playermatch` = player match, `pbp` = match play-by-play), division (1, 2, 3), and year (2020-2024) combination is a separate file. <!--For instance, the women's team season data for division 1 in 2020 can be found in `wvb_teamseason_div1_2020.csv`. -->
