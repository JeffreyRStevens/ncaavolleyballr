Inspired by the NCAA data extraction functions from the [`{baseballr}`](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) package, the goal of `{ncaavolleyballr}` is to extract women\'s and men\'s volleyball information from the NCAA website. The functions in this package can extract team records/schedules and player statistics for the 2020-`r ncaavolleyballr:::most_recent_season()` NCAA women\'s and men\'s divisions I, II, and III volleyball teams. Functions can aggregate statistics for teams, conferences, divisions, or custom groups of teams.

## Installation

You can install developmental versions from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JeffreyRStevens/ncaavolleyballr")
```

## Usage

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(ncaavolleyballr)
```

### Season data

The NCAA uses a unique team ID for each women\'s and men\'s volleyball team and each season. So first you will need to get that ID with the `find_team_id()`. For instance, to find the ID for University of Nebraska\'s 2024 season:
```{r}
find_team_id("Nebraska", 2024)
```

With this team ID, you can now extract team information about the arena, coach, record, and schedule with `team_season_stats()`.

```{r}
team_info <- find_team_id("Nebraska", 2024) |> 
  team_season_stats()
team_info$arena
team_info$coach
team_info$record
team_info$schedule
```

There is also roster and overall season performance data on individual players with the `player_season_stats()`. 

```{r}
find_team_id("Nebraska", 2024) |> 
  player_season_stats()
```

By default, these functions return information on women\'s teams, but they can be set to return men\'s information by setting `sport = "MVB"`. You can also aggregate data across conferences, divisions, or custom groups with `conference_stats()`, `division_stats()`, and `group_stats()`.


### Match data

The NCAA also uses a unique contest ID for each women\'s and men\'s volleyball match. The easiest way to get that ID is with `find_team_contest()`, which returns the contest ID for all matches in a particular season (using the Team ID provided by `find_team_id()`). For instance, to find the contest ID for 2024 National Championship match between Louisville and Penn State:

```{r}
find_team_id("Penn St.", 2024) |> 
  find_team_contests() |> 
  tail()
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
psu2024 <- find_team_contests(find_team_id("Penn St.", 2024))
```


From that, we can see that the contest ID is `r psu2024[psu2024$opponent == "Louisville", ]$contest[2]`. If we pass this contest ID to the `player_match_stats()` function, we'll get a list with two data frames---one for each team in the contest---that contain player statistics for the match. If we want to get just the Penn State player data, we can set `team = "Penn St."`.

```{r}
player_match_stats(contest = "6080706", team = "Penn St.")
```

Play-by-play data are also available with `match_pbp()`. This returns a data frame with all events and players.

```{r}
match_pbp(contest = "6080706") |> 
  head(10)
```
