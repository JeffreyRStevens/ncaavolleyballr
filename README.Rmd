The goal of `{volleyballr}` is to extract women's volleyball information from the NCAA website.

## Installation

You can install developmental versions from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("JeffreyRStevens/volleyballr")
```

## Example

```{r}
library(volleyballr)
```


The NCAA uses a unique team ID for each women's volleyball team and each season. So first you will need to get that ID with the `find_team_id()`. For instance, to find the ID for University of Nebraska's 2024 season:
```{r}
find_team_id("Nebraska", 2024)
```

With this team ID, you can now extract team information about the arena, coach, record, and schedule.

```{r}
team_info <- find_team_id("Nebraska", 2024) |> 
  team_season()
team_info$arena
team_info$coach
team_info$record
team_info$schedule
```

There is also roster and overall season performance data on individual players. 

```{r}
find_team_id("Nebraska", 2024) |> 
  player_stats() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```
